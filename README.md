**Advanced Fake News Detection System**
Using PySpark and TF-IDF for Large-Scale News Classification
Overview
This project implements a scalable fake news detection system using PySpark's distributed computing capabilities and advanced text processing techniques. The system leverages TF-IDF vectorization along with machine learning classifiers to identify misinformation in news articles in real-time.
Features
